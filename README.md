# nowInStockTracker
nowInStockTracker tracks stock of products found at nowinstock.net and sends an alert.
This is still a work in progress as I figure things out.

To do list:
add proxies,
keep track of pings,
add links to product page

Originally, this was intended to track only PS5 listings, but some friends requested I add GPUs as well, so I did.
